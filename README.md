I'm mostly a generalist at the moment, with maximum experience in backend development with Django. Aside from that, I've worked on various other projects in Python, some animation/simulation in JS using p5.js, and have some competitive programming experience. Recently I've been dabbling in Machine Learning, C/C++, and TypeScript - in particular the MEAN stack.


I'm looking to collaborate on full stack web applications or machine learning (academic or solution-based) projects.
