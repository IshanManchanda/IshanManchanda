I'm a second-year undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur based out of Gurgaon. I'm mostly a generalist at the moment, with maximum experience in backend development with Django and Deep Learning with PyTorch.

I've developed several backend systems such as the one for Thought Processors ([Static Website](https://thoughtprocessors.netlify.app/)) and [StaightZero](https://straightzero.in). At StraightZero, I co-developed a payment system using the PayUMoney API, a live test-taking platform, and a supplementary material hosting service in a team of just two.

I was recently part of my insitute's contingent for the Bosch's Model Extraction Attack for Video Classification event at the Inter IIT Tech Meet 10.0 in which my team placed first. I worked on various aspects of Deep Learning in the blackbox setting including data-free adversarial distillation and data-free Conditional GAN training.  
I was also a part of the Aerial Robotics Kharagpur Research Group where I worked with Machine Learning and Computer Vision as an undergraduate researcher in the Perception team.

Aside from these two fields, I've worked on various other projects in Python (API Consumers, Image Processing, Machine Learning, Web Scraping and other short scripts), some simulations in JS using p5.js, and have some competitive programming experience.

I'm also a part of the Kharagpur Open Source Society where I learn and teach about various components of software development like architecture and the internals of different programming languages.
